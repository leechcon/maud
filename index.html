                <p class="text-xl text-pretty">Maud Rowell is a writer, translator, and poet based in London. After studying Japanese at the University of Cambridge, she trained as a journalist, and worked freelance for several years, writing for brands like Art UK, Hidden Compass, and SUITCASE magazine. She was diagnosed with a rare, degenerative form of blindness aged 19, and often uses writingâ€”a craft she has loved and worked at all her lifeâ€”to educate and engage people on disability, encouraging audiences to see differently.</p>
                <p class="text-xl text-pretty">Her debut book, Blind Spot: Exploring and Educating on Blindness (404 Ink, 2021) is a collection of essays which carry readers on a whirlwind tour through time and spaceâ€”from Japanese tube stations to the 18th century museumâ€” to showcase what the world looks like for someone who does not see. She offers practical insights based on her own experiences, as well as spotlighting incredible blind pioneersâ€”explorers, artists, scientists, and moreâ€”through history and the current day.</p>
                <p class="text-xl text-pretty">In 2021, she won an international competition, the Holman Prize (run by the San Francisco-based charity, LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired), securing $25,000 with which to do any ambitious, creative project and challenge prevailing ideas of what the blind can do. In June 2022, she embarked on a year-long solo journey around some of Japanâ€™s remotest parts, from uninhabited islands to volcanoes hundreds of kilometres out to sea. She returned to the UK in July 2023 and is now working on her next book, a work of literary travel writing about her Holman Prize journey. </p>
                <p class="text-xl text-pretty">When sheâ€™s not working on that project, she can be found writing waka (a form of classical Japanese poem with a 5-7-5-7-7 syllable pattern) about light, grief, trees, and language, or surrealist short stories in Japanese. She also inherited a love of film photography from her father, and likes to use black-and-white or colour infrared film loaded into battered old cameras to articulate non-normative ways of seeing. By day, she works in Northern Ireland policy for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and as a type of parliamentary reporter for the House of Commons.</p>
